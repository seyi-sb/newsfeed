The monumental antitrust case has steadily evolved over the years, with the DOJ proposing remedies like Google opening up its search engine tech to licensing, prohibiting agreements with device makers like <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/apple/\">Apple</a> and Samsung to ensure Google was the default search engine and forcing the sale of the Chrome browser and the open-source Chromium project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Google, the Department of Justice's proposed actions would open consumers up to &quot;very real privacy issues,&quot; leave the government in charge of user data and help &quot;well-funded competitors.&quot; Instead, Google offered to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-proposes-alternative-remedies-for-its-search-monopoly-after-doj-demands-radical-changes-185253526.html\">loosen its agreements</a> to allow other search engines on devices and create an oversight committee to monitor the company's activities.</p>\n<p>Since then, the federal judge presiding over the case, Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopolist-in-search-us-judge-rules-in-antitrust-case-193358356.html\">ruled in August 2024</a> that Google had an illegal monopoly of the search engine market.

Netflix has finally revealed the release date for the show's fifth and final season: November 26. At least, that's when the first part will drop.

Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished \u2014 his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will\u2019s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming \u2014 and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they\u2019ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they\u2019ll need everyone \u2014 the full party \u2014 standing together, one last time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With that, the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/stranger-things-season-5-release-date\">countdown</a> to the end has officially begun.

They'll then have to address whatever requirements it laid out to resolve the issues before the product can be released.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A former Meta executive told <em>NPR</em> that reducing scrutiny &quot;means you're creating higher risks. Negative externalities of product changes are less likely to be prevented before they start causing problems in the world.&quot; In a statement to <em>NPR</em>, Meta said it would still tap &quot;human expertise&quot; to evaluate &quot;novel and complex issues,&quot; and leave the &quot;low-risk decisions&quot; to AI.

The game's developer <a href=\"https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471\">posted on X</a> that Patch 1.02 will be released next week, delivering some bug fixes and \"improvements for solo expeditions.\"</p>\n<p>More specifically, FromSoftware will add the effect of \u201cAutomatic Revival Upon Defeat\u201d that allows a self-revival once per night boss battle for solo expeditions. Players will also get more runes, which should provide a more balanced gaming experience when venturing alone. This news of this patch follows several criticisms of the game being poorly optimized when playing solo, versus in a party of three as it was designed for.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>FromSoftware's titles have a reputation for being difficult, but early reviews pointed out that <em>Nightreign</em> offers poor scaling with certain mechanics, abilities and boss fights that cater towards a full party. Despite the millions of copies sold on the first day,<em> Nightreign</em> holds a \"<a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/\">mixed</a>\" Steam user review rating thanks to the solo queue issues, along with a lack of communication tools, cross-platform play and less replayability than other Souls titles.</p>\n<p>For FromSoftware, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> represents a stylistic shift into the roguelike genre based on its best-selling predecessor and it might still be working out some of the kinks. The game's director, Junya Ishizaki, told <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first\"><em>IGN</em></a> in an interview that jumping into an expedition as a duo was \u201coverlooked during development\u201d but is something that the developer is looking at and considering for post-launch support. Some players are also having issues with matchmaking itself, where FromSoftware recommends restarting the process to get into an expedition. As for rebalancing for solo play, FromSoftware said that more details about this upcoming patch will come next week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-patch-will-make-gameplay-easier-for-solo-players-183644323.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>Nebraska is the latest state to crack down on how kids can use social media. The state's governor, Jim Pillen, recently signed into law a package of bills aimed at restricting certain social media features that keep kids hooked on the platform. The final bill signed, called the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=59284\">Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act</a>, will require companies to offer time limits on usage, restrict certain categories of content and provide chronological feeds instead of algorithmic ones that promote infinite scrolling.</p>\n<p>The Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act, also known as LB504, details that social media companies can only collect the minimum amount of personal data from younger users, and offers parents more tools to limit how their children use their accounts. Along with those restrictions, the law prohibits any ads related to gambling, alcohol, tobacco or drugs from reaching kids on social media.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Alongside LB504, the signed package of bills includes LB140 that limits student use of smartphones in schools, LB383 that requires social media companies to verify the age of its users and require parental consent for creating accounts, and LB172 that creates criminal penalties for AI-generated pornography.</p>\n<p>\"Collectively, all these bills have an incredible impact on helping our teachers and giving our schools the opportunity to teach our kids, instead of being disrupted in the classroom,\" Pillen said in a press release. \"They also provide parents with the tools they need to protect our kids from big tech online companies and predators.\"</p>\n<p>The law is set to go into effect January 1, 2026, and any companies that violate these new regulations will face civil penalties.

    "title": "Playdate Season 2 review: Fulcrum Defender, Dig! Dig! Dino! and Blippo+",
    "summary": "<p>Playdate Season Two is here, bringing with it two new games for the quirky yellow handheld every week until July 3. And if the first two titles are any indication of what this season will be like, it's sure to be a great one. Season Two kicked off on May 29 with the arcade action game <em>Fulcrum Defender</em> \u2014 from the studio behind <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em> and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-into-the-breach-subset-games-ftl-sequel-gameplay-video.html\"><em>Into the Breach</em></a> \u2014 and<em>&nbsp;</em>the delightfully chill <em>Dig! Dig! Dino!</em>. The two games couldn't be more different from each other, but they're both bangers in their own right.</p>\n<p>Panic also released <em>Blippo+</em>, which can only be described as a fever dream of cable TV,<em>&nbsp;</em>with the first drop of Season Two, and it is amazingly bizarre.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-fulcrum-defender\">Fulcrum Defender</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"A still from the Playdate game Fulcrum Defender showing a white circular arena at the center of a black screen, with several small enemy circles closing in on a turret in the middle\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/ab9c3aa0-3e25-11f0-b9df-f9b125cf8573\" style=\"height: 1432px; width: 2390px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Subset Games</div></figure>\n<p>\"Survive for 10min!\" sounded almost like a threat when I first started reading through <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://play.date/games/fulcrum-defender/\"><em>Fulcrum Defender</em></a>'s How To Play guide. Between all the on-screen information you need to pay attention to, the many different types of enemies that'll be attacking and the various weapon upgrades you can earn over the course of a run, there's a lot to take in, and I braced myself for a tense and complicated playing experience. But, while that may be closer to the case on Hard Mode, I found that <em>Fulcrum Defender </em>wasn't all that punishing of a shooter on Normal Mode. It's a challenge, for sure, but one with a surprisingly achievable goal that I was able to enjoy without losing my mind. At least, not until crossing the 10-minute mark. After that, all hell breaks loose.</p>\n<p>In <em>Fulcrum Defender</em>, you're positioned at the center of a circular arena and have to fend off a continuous swarm of enemies. Your shield will take damage any time an enemy collides with it, and once enough have breached that zone, it's game over. To avoid that, you need to shoot them down one by one, using the crank to aim your weapon and the D-pad to shoot. Some enemies can be taken out in one shot, but others \u2014 distinguished by their filled-in appearance \u2014 require multiple shots. Over time, you'll earn weapon upgrades to build out a more powerful defense system, with options like large, guided projectiles and a flail that can knock out several enemies in one sweep.</p>\n<p>It's unexpectedly addicting. The music is beautiful and calming, giving the whole thing a pleasant atmosphere despite the fact that you're surrounded by enemies at any given moment and trying not to die. Once I realized it was absolutely possible to survive 10 minutes and even go beyond that, I got sucked into the loop of trying over and over to beat my high scores. I'd love to see a global leaderboard for this game at some point, because I just know I'd be floored by how long some players will be able to last.</p>\n<p>If you liked this one and want to know a little more about the making of it, be sure to check out our <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subset-games-co-founder-jay-ma-went-through-hell-to-make-fulcrum-defender-153028909.html?guccounter=1\">interview with Jay Ma</a>, the co-founder of <em>Fulcrum Defender</em> developer Subset Games.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-dig-dig-dino\">Dig! Dig! Dino!</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"A still from the Playdate game Dig! Dig! Dino! showing a dig site with grids where a skull and other artifacts have been unearthed.

No thoughts, just dig. That's exactly what <em>Dig! Dig! Dino!</em> has going on, and it's awesome.</p>\n<p>You're working as part of a crew (made up entirely of anthropomorphic animals) at the site of some really unusual dinosaur fossils, and it's your job to dig up new bones and artifacts. Once you've got the entire skeleton of a particular dinosaur, you can scan it in the lab to reveal what it was like when it was alive. That information, coupled with the peculiar artifacts scattered around the site, paints a picture of some pretty strange activities that went on there long ago. For example, some of these dinosaurs seem to have had crystals growing out of their bodies, and it looks like they were warned about the asteroid extinction event. Fishy!</p>\n<p>The gameplay is extremely low stakes \u2014 this is one for when you just want to zone out playing something that'll keep your hands busy. You're equipped with a shovel, a drill and a radar gadget for detecting items beneath the surface, and have no time-sensitive goals to hit. You only have so much energy, though, which will be consumed with each use of your tools. When you run out, the round is over. But you can visit each site as many times as you need to in order to find all of the dinosaur pieces hidden there, so it can be a really casual undertaking if you want it to be.</p>\n<p>It's a really nice time, with a fun story to tie it all together. You'll get a solid few hours of playtime out of this, too, and the simplicity of it all means you can put it down and come back to it later without having to rack your memory to figure out where you left off.

Panic describes it as being \"comparable to an old episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>,\" but it's more like an old episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em> if it were made by Tim &amp; Eric and aired after midnight on Adult Swim. I think I am obsessed with it?</p>\n<p>I'm really interested to see where this goes.

It features deals aplenty on PlayStation 5 consoles, accessories and games, as well as PS Plus subscriptions. One of the more intriguing discounts is for the PS5 DualSense Edge. The premium controller has dropped by 15 percent from $200 to $169. That's the lowest price to date for the peripheral. The deal is available on <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DSQQ1P8D&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5858c989-5eed-4f75-8065-b8a61a3ac9fa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1BsYXlTdGF0aW9uLUR1YWxTZW5zZS1XaXJlbGVzcy1Db250cm9sbGVyLUdhbWluZy1Db25zb2xlL2RwL0IwRFNRUTFQOEQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTg1OGM5ODktNWVlZC00Zjc1LTgwNjUtYjhhNjFhM2FjOWZhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1BsYXlTdGF0aW9uLUR1YWxTZW5zZS1XaXJlbGVzcy1Db250cm9sbGVyLUdhbWluZy1Db25zb2xlL2RwL0IwRFNRUTFQOEQiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfu5bh7-4z_J9MBYL0Cz-Ti0H4_H-2owcM-1IcCTGG3X&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console%2Fdp%2FB0DSQQ1P8D\">Amazon</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5858c989-5eed-4f75-8065-b8a61a3ac9fa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=from+Sony+directly&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RpcmVjdC5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvYnV5LWFjY2Vzc29yaWVzL2R1YWxzZW5zZS1lZGdlLXdpcmVsZXNzLWNvbnRyb2xsZXI_c21jaWQ9cGRjOnVzLWVuOndlYi1wZGMtYWNjZXNzb3JpZXM6YnV0dG9uYmxvY2stYnV5LW5vdyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTg1OGM5ODktNWVlZC00Zjc1LTgwNjUtYjhhNjFhM2FjOWZhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RpcmVjdC5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvYnV5LWFjY2Vzc29yaWVzL2R1YWxzZW5zZS1lZGdlLXdpcmVsZXNzLWNvbnRyb2xsZXI_c21jaWQ9cGRjOnVzLWVuOndlYi1wZGMtYWNjZXNzb3JpZXM6YnV0dG9uYmxvY2stYnV5LW5vdyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaX334RgklDOCoFFNGCokT79aOT5ckAAYZG9HS6iVdD3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-edge-wireless-controller%3Fsmcid%3Dpdc%3Aus-en%3Aweb-pdc-accessories%3Abuttonblock-buy-now\">from Sony directly</a>.</p> \n<p>The layout apes that of the regular DualSense controller, but there's a lot more going on with the Edge. For instance, there are function buttons below each thumbstick that allow you to swap between button configurations (which you can customize at any time in the PS5 settings). On the rear, there are switches that enable you to change the pull length of the shoulder triggers. There are also rear paddles, and you can choose between a set of levers or shorter half-domes.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>It's possible to swap out the thumbsticks as well and, because they attach to the controller magnetically, it's a cinch to do so. Other than the standard nubs, you can choose between short-stemmed convex and long-stemmed convex options. There's also a cable lock that prevents you from accidentally removing the USB-C charging cable by accident.</p> \n<p>You might want to keep that cable plugged in. One of the major downsides of the DualSense Edge is its battery life. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-dualsense-edge-review-sonys-pricey-but-powerful-sidekick-for-the-ps5-130041956.html\">In our testing</a>, we got around five to six hours of use on a single charge, less than the six or seven we get with the standard DualSense.</p> \n<p>Last but not least, the DualSense Edge comes with a hardshell carrying case. There's even a passthrough flap through which you can thread a USB-C cable to charge the controller while it's cocooned in the case.</p> \n<p>There are, of course, lots of other intriguing discounts in the Days of Play sale, including one on the standard <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0CQKLS4RP&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5858c989-5eed-4f75-8065-b8a61a3ac9fa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=PS5+DualSense+controller&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAUglGLk8GALhsWNavlsGMUtlflm19wNbuqzNn0wfSYYC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlayStation-DualSense%2525C2%2525AE-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-5%2Fdp%2FB0CQKLS4RP%2F\">PS5 DualSense controller</a>.

    "title": "'28 Years Later' used 20 iPhones in tandem for some wild shots",
    "summary": "<p>It's no secret that <em>28 Years Later</em> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/28-years-later-was-partially-shot-on-an-iphone-15-pro-max-182036483.html\">used iPhones</a> to shoot parts of the film. Now its director, Danny Boyle, has discussed the use of iPhones for the film in more detail with <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/28-years-later-danny-boyle-goes-big-with-horror-sequel-widescreen-the-infected\"><em>IGN</em></a>. The first film in the franchise, <em>28 Days Later</em>, was shot on digital video, giving it a homemade feel. Boyle explained that he and writer <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-elden-ring-movie-directed-by-alex-garland-is-in-the-works-123042735.html\">Alex Garland</a> got the idea from the fact that home video cameras were common at the time, and people would've shot videos with them if an apocalypse had indeed happened. Those cameras, of course, have since been replaced by smartphones.</p>\n<p>The movies used three special rigs for the iPhone sequences: One for eight cameras that one person can carry, another with 10 and another with 20. &quot;I never say this, but there is an incredible shot in the second half [of the film] where we use the 20-rig camera, and you'll know it when you see it,&quot; Boyle told <em>IGN</em>. He described the 20-iPhone rig as &quot;basically a poor man\u2019s bullet time,&quot; which is a visual effect that uses multiple cameras to freeze or slow down time. Think the scene in<em> The Matrix</em>, wherein Neo dodged bullets in super slow motion.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Doyle said that the 20-camera rig can be attached to cranes or dollies and give you 180 degrees of vision of an action. In editing, you can choose from any of the footage each iPhone takes to, say, move between perspectives or jump forward and backward. For <em>28 Years Later,</em> the team used the rig for violent scenes to emphasize their effect. &quot;For a moment the audience is inside the scene, the action, rather than classically observing a picture,&quot; Doyle explained.</p>\n<p>In addition to the iPhones, the filmmakers also used drones, cameras attached to actors and even farm animals to achieve an immersive feel for its 2.76:1 widescreen aspect ratio. They decided on the aspect ratio to create a sense of unease, since you'd have to keep scanning the screen to see potential threats coming from the sides.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"28 years Later\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/0f2caab0-3e1b-11f0-adbf-ddc55804db87\" style=\"height: 1667px; width: 2500px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony</div></figure>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/28-years-later-used-20-iphones-in-tandem-for-some-wild-shots-130043338.html?src=rss",

This particular model is one of Sonos' newest, and it has rarely gone on sale in the past.</p> \n<p>We enjoyed the Era 300 enough to give it a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html\">score of 80</a> in our review. It has excellent sound quality and offers a premium experience that far surpasses other products in the company's lineup, even the Era 100. This is also true when compared to rival speakers like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html\">Apple's HomePod</a>.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>It's simple to set up and offers the company's proprietary Trueplay tuning system. This feature optimizes the sound of the speaker to the unique acoustics of a room by leveraging an internal microphone. It measures how sound reflects off surfaces and adjusts the EQ to match. It's pretty nifty.</p> \n<p>As for connectivity, it can pair with another Era 300 speaker for a true stereo experience. It also includes a Bluetooth receiver and line-in options. Of course, the speaker integrates with just about every streaming music service. The built-in mic also allows for voice assistant control, but only with Siri and Alexa. Google Assistant is left out of the party.</p> \n<p>This speaker goes all-in on spatial audio, and the results are mixed. Sometimes it's sublime and sometimes it's kind of eh. This is more of a dig on the technology itself. It has serious potential but is still experiencing growing pains. The only real downside of this speaker is the exorbitant asking price, which has been slightly alleviated by this sale.</p> \n<p>As previously mentioned, other Sonos products are available at a discount.

    "summary": "<p>One of the many beautiful things about the indie gaming scene is that there's <em>always </em>something to check out. So if you don't fancy playing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-details-all-eight-classes-and-some-fiery-hazards-151216173.html\"><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em></a> this weekend, there are plenty of other new options. To help you keep up with what's going on in the space, here's our weekly indie game roundup.</p>\n<p>As a heads up, we won't be publishing an edition of this roundup next week. Not because there won't be enough games to highlight. Quite the opposite: Summer Game Fest kicks off on Friday June 6. There will be literally hundreds of game announcements and updates. There's also the small matter of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-updates-ahead-of-the-june-5-launch-date-140931884.html\">Nintendo Switch 2's arrival</a> in a matter of days.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You can check out what to expect from SGF and find out how to watch the various showcases in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-what-to-expect-and-how-to-watch-games-revealed-live-000016769.html\">our preview</a>. We'll be bringing you news on titles of all shapes and sizes from Summer Game Fest Live, Xbox Games Showcase and other events. We'll also be on the ground in Los Angeles to go hands on with many of the newly announced games. Keep up with our coverage here on Engadget throughout SGF.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, there are a host of new games to savor, as well as peeks at what's coming your way in the coming weeks and months. Let's get to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-thinky-direct\">Thinky Direct</h2>\n<div id=\"9e0b3412c081435bb148bd8f2af8543a\"></div>\n<p>This showcase from <em>Thinky Games</em> was jam packed with captivating puzzle and mystery games. Two in particular caught my eye. The first is a very intriguing first-person archery puzzler. In <em>He Who Watches</em>, you'll walk on walls, rotate rooms and use a bow and arrow to solve puzzles. It reminds me of the shrines in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070500/He_Who_Watches/\">A demo is out now on Steam</a> and the full game should arrive this fall.</p>\n<div id=\"8c2f56444e97436187e98ca05ed24f85\"></div>\n<p>The other game that really stood out to me was <em>Echo Weaver</em>, a so-called &quot;Metroidbrainia.&quot; Unlike in many Metroidvanias, where you need to find power ups or new abilities to progress, here you'll move forward by acquiring knowledge, including figuring out your character's special abilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There aren't any procedurally generated elements in <em>Echo Weaver</em>. As with the likes of <em>Outer Wilds</em>, each run is time-based. You can find ways to extend the limit or sacrifice some time to pass through a barrier. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184080/Echo_Weaver/\"><em>Echo Weaver</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam and Xbox (including Game Pass).</p>\n<p>There was lots of other interesting stuff in the first-ever Thinky Direct. I really enjoy the chill train puzzler <em>Railbound </em>and it was neat to find out that there's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytdD7j0xYc\">level editor</a> available in beta. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916300/Kikos_Apple_Adventure/\"><em>Kiko's Apple Adventure</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is an adorable-looking block-pushing game in which the aim is to nudge apples onto rafts. It just arrived on Steam.</p>\n<div id=\"ebd75ddd4d0e46b99bfa723864e59bd0\"></div>\n<p><em>The Button Effect</em> features a museum with a lot of buttons, each with a purpose for you to find out. It seems like a certain <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiD9qn5q4RY\"><em>Taskmaster </em>task</a> taken to new extremes. The first public demo just hit <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3563110/The_Button_Effect__Demo/\">Steam</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"0b5e04eafbaf498ebb85a892e6b3dbe7\"></div>\n<p><em>Nonolith </em>is another compelling game that was featured in the showcase. In this puzzle platformer, you can copy and paste blocks to create openings, bridges and staircases. The vibe reminds me a little of <em>Animal Well</em>. <em>Monolith</em> is <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3203340/Nonolith/\">coming to Steam</a> in 2026.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2>\n<p>One thing definitely worth getting excited about this week if you own a particular yellow console with a crank owner is the start of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-two-includes-an-action-arcade-game-from-into-the-breach-studio-subset-181438605.html\">Playdate Season Two</a>. Every Thursday throughout the six-week season (which costs $39), two new games arrive on Panic's diminutive device.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first batch includes the charming-looking <em>Dig! Dig! Dino! </em>and <em>Fulcrum Defender</em>. The latter of those is from <em>FTL: Faster Than Light </em>and <em>Into the Breach </em>studio Subset Games, whose <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subset-games-co-founder-jay-ma-went-through-hell-to-make-fulcrum-defender-153028909.html\">co-founder Jay Ma went through hell to make <em>Fulcrum Defender</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<div id=\"b73a1618d5ee42f5ac319c290233b959\"></div>\n<p>One of the titles included in the season, <em>Blippo+</em>, is a full-motion <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/\">video game</a>. It will have weekly episodic updates for 12 weeks, extending far beyond the rest of the Season Two window. The first episode is out now.</p>\n<div id=\"cf7f9357facf4931b9bd23b53761bed6\"></div>\n<p><em>Trails </em>is a lovely puzzle game that <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3605120/Trails/\">just landed on Steam</a>. You'll guide sandships to their destination by drawing a path for them. You can't take a ship through the same square twice, and you'll need to make sure they don't crash into each other. There are obstacles, of course, and you'll sometimes have to collect and deliver cargo.</p>\n<p>I've enjoyed my time with <em>Trails </em>so far. Developer PurpleSloth gradually teaches you how to play through trial and error, and it adds new hazards and mechanics at a nice pace, though the puzzles do become quite tricky.</p>\n<div id=\"1da0d02615ba404e87a93a8e52f1f70f\"></div>\n<p>You may have spent many pleasant hours cleaning grime off of various objects and iconic landmarks in <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>(which is set to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/powerwash-simulator-2-will-arrive-later-this-year-164534571.html\">get a sequel later this year</a>). It's time to flip the script a bit in <em>Spray Paint Simulator, </em>from North Star Video Games and publisher Whitethorn Games.</p>\n<p>The concept is pretty similar, in that you'll complete jobs for clients by painting certain items or environments. There are no time limits here and a feature that lets you mask an area to ensure you get clean lines is a nice touch. If marking your territory on public or private property with sick, definitely-not-ugly tags is more your thing, there's a free spray mode that you can play alone or with a friend in co-op.</p>\n<p><em>Spray Paint Simulator </em>is out now on Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's on Game Pass too. The game is also coming to Nintendo Switch on June 19.</p>\n<div id=\"4198b23bc6314e5c99d0ed8b3746431d\"></div>\n<p><em>Eternal Evil </em>debuted on Steam back in 2022, and two and a half years later, the survival horror game has made the jump to <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012383\">PS5</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1034155a-d7a9-4760-9964-bd48db5a2f20&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9ldGVybmFsLWV2aWwvOVA0RkJUN0YwOEZTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMDM0MTU1YS1kN2E5LTQ3NjAtOTk2NC1iZDQ4ZGI1YTJmMjAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2V0ZXJuYWwtZXZpbC85UDRGQlQ3RjA4RlMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkOPjQARFL9hlBV_c1iz_MLAypEpVD2J6IvwNEHUm3V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Feternal-evil%2F9P4FBT7F08FS\">Xbox Series X/S</a>. It has mostly positive reviews on Steam and seems very much in the vein of the Resident Evil series (it even has a dual narrative with two characters to play). You'll take on vampires that get stronger as they feed in this game from solo developer Honor Games.</p>\n<div id=\"0dea68b76f4f4d2a99b8bb074883f483\"></div>\n<p>How could I not include a game with a name like <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407830/Trash_Goblin/\"><em>Trash Goblin</em></a>? This is a cozy shopkeeping title from Spilt Milk Studios that just came out of early access on Steam. You'll unearth, restore and upcycle trinkets to sell to customers so you can upgrade your shop. It seems one you might chill out with.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <em>To a T,</em> a game <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/chaotic-deliveries-colorful-co-op-action-rpgs-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-140023626.html\">we mentioned last week</a>, is out now on Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, PS5, Steam and the Epic Games Store. Cowboy-themed life sim <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qttnZq5qOb4\"><em>Cowboy Country</em></a> just landed on Steam, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-upcoming\">Upcoming</h2>\n<div id=\"ec799f9c905b4cd5888dedeba7c8bc3a\"></div>\n<p>I've had my eye on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/\"><em>Kingmakers</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>for a while. It's a completely bananas-looking blend of third-person shooting and strategy game from Redemption Road in which you travel back in time to a medieval war, bringing modern weapons and vehicles with you. Publisher tinyBuild revealed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=606Yo4KbCSU\">during a showcase</a> this week that <em>Kingmakers </em>will debut in early access on Steam on October 8. Really looking forward to that one.</p>\n<div id=\"47ea9e7181f84e22a587e0da5dc4555d\"></div>\n<p><em>Beyond the Board </em>is a moody-looking adventure that takes a rook... well, beyond a chess board. It takes inspiration from puzzle games like <em>Limbo </em>and <em>Monument Valley</em>, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that the story is told through visual storytelling and soundscapes rather than dialogue. This game from Fragile Shapes Studio doesn't yet have a release window, but you can check out <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2794160/Beyond_The_Board/\">a demo on Steam now</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"35022f6e5fca418f8fb1588daa3f9bb8\"></div>\n<p>An extended demo for a fast-paced, melee-focused dungeon runner called <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/\"><em>Bloodthief</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>dropped this week. It looks like a lo-fi, medieval spin on Ghostrunner (a series <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ghostrunner-2-is-brutally-punishing-but-it-feels-too-good-to-give-up-on-160456973.html\">I enjoy but am quite bad at</a>) but with vampires. So yes, I will be digging into this when I have a chance. The original demo is said to have 20 or so hours of gameplay and there's even more in the extended version, which will be featured in Steam Next Fest. <em>Bloodthief</em>, from developer Blargis, is slated to arrive later this year.</p>\n<p>I'm going to close this edition out with a game you'll probably never be able to play. Developer Kenney says that, a few years back, they helped a young Star Wars fan make a game based on <em>The Mandalorian </em>after a Make-a-Wish connected the pair. It's a heartwarming story, and the game looks quite charming based on the clip that Kenney <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kenney.nl/post/3lq7pt3t6es25\">shared on BlueSky</a>. However, for legal reasons, it'll likely stay under lock and key, sadly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-two-spray-paint-simulator-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110035699.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>Twitch is getting more TikTok-ified with vertical game streaming. Also, &quot;2K&quot; (1440p) video will let you watch that League of Legends stream in a higher resolution. The ability to rewind streams is coming, too. CEO Dan Clancy made the announcements on Saturday at TwitchCon Europe.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-launches-reels-to-beat-tiktok-130009783.html\">Portrait-mode streaming</a> makes it a little easier to watch gameplay on your phone. Until now, Twitch only supported the orientation for clips and IRL streams. Clips are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitchs-new-clip-editor-makes-it-easier-to-create-vertical-videos-092950134.html\">short highlights that creators can share</a> after a stream ends. And &quot;In Real Life&quot; content shows everyday activities rather than gameplay.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But some screens work much better in a landscape view. Fortunately, Twitch is also rolling out a dual-format mode. Creators can go live in vertical and horizontal orientations at once. You can watch the version that works best for your device. The company will begin testing &quot;with a small number of channels&quot; this summer. It will expand access later this year.</p>\n<p>Twitch's 1440p streams should be a welcome addition. (Who doesn't like a sharper-looking video?) On the back end, it uses a newer HEVC codec that produces a better picture with a lower bitrate. And the platform's Enhanced Broadcasting tech automatically tweaks the viewer's resolution.</p>\n<p>The 1440p streaming begins rolling out today to all partners and affiliates. But it's in an open beta, so creators may need to wait for access.</p>\n<p>Finally, Twitch is rolling out a rewind feature. If you miss part of a stream, you can scrub back to catch up on what you missed. That feature isn't quite here yet, either. Twitch will test it with &quot;a small number of viewers&quot; this summer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/twitch-is-adding-1440p-and-vertical-streaming-091533811.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Video Games Weekly: I still don't miss E3",
    "summary": "<p><em>Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please enjoy \u2014 and I'll see you next week.</em></p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><hr />\n<p>It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-what-new-game-announcements-to-expect-and-how-to-watch-162140617.html\">the week of Summer Game Fest</a>, so I\u2019m mentally wrapped up in a complex web of embargoes, meetings, schedules and cryptic invites, and I can already smell the plasticky, sanitized air that accompanies <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/\">video game</a> conventions of all sizes. <em>Mmm, smells like pixels.</em></p>\n<p>This will be my third SGF and I\u2019m looking forward to it, as usual. I appreciate the event\u2019s focus on independent projects, diverse creators and smaller-scale publishers, particularly with shows like Day of the Devs, Wholesome Direct, Women-Led Games, and the Latin American and Southeast Asian games showcases. I deeply believe that innovation in the industry stems from these untethered, experimental spaces, and SGF has consistently provided room for these types of experiences to shine.</p>\n<p>I appreciate SGF even more after spending seven years wandering the cavernous halls of the Los Angeles Convention Center, covering the Electronic Entertainment Expo. E3 was exciting in its own right and I feel privileged to have attended it so many times, but it was also a soulless kind of show. E3 was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-16-how-10-indie-developers-got-into-e3-legally-with-indies-crash.html\">unwelcoming</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-16-breaking-down-the-cost-of-an-e3-booth.html\">independent creators</a> and packed with corporate swag, and by the time Sony decided to stop attending in 2019, it felt like an expensive, out-of-touch misrepresentation of the video game industry as a whole. The best parts of E3 in its final years were the unaffiliated events hosted by Devolver Digital, which took place in a nearby parking lot packed with Airstream trailers, food trucks and fabulous, up-and-coming indie games. It felt a lot like SGF, in fact.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-04-e3-2019-indie-games-esa-sony-devolver.html\">wrote about this phenomenon</a> in 2018, in a story that questioned whether the video game industry needed E3 at all. Perhaps because I\u2019m a witch but mostly due to the pandemic, E3 shut down in 2020 and it never re-emerged as an in-person show. The Entertainment Software Association hosted one virtual session in 2021, but nothing afterward, and E3 was officially <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/e3-is-officially-dead-153411735.html\">declared dead</a> in December 2023. Meanwhile, the video game market has <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/media/games/worldwide?currency=USD\">continued to grow</a>, driven by a maturing indie segment, mobile play and harsh <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/layoffs-are-sucking-the-joy-out-of-video-games--this-weeks-gaming-news-174541450.html\">crunch-layoff cycles</a> at the AAA level.</p>\n<p>Now, the ESA is back with a new video game showcase called <a href=\"https://www.iicon.com/\">iicon</a>, the Interactive Innovation Conference, heading to Las Vegas in April 2026. The industry\u2019s biggest names are involved, including <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, Sony, Nintendo, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Disney, Amazon and Take-Two Interactive, and the show is poised to be \u201ca space for visionaries across industries to come together,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/\">according to ESA president</a> Stanley Pierre-Louis. E3 2.0 has arrived, and it seems to be as AAA-focused as ever. For what it\u2019s worth, Summer Game Fest has its own version of a AAA thought-leader summit this year with <a href=\"https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-wizards-of-the-coast-twitch\">The Game Business Live</a>.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the ESA has remained silent \u2014 even <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/grand-theft-autos-publisher-abandons-dei-for-diversity-of-thought-in-annual-report/\">when directly asked</a> \u2014 as some of the industry\u2019s most influential companies roll back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, at a time when women, POC and LGBT+ employees are enduring active existential threats. And <em>during Pride Month</em>, no less.</p>\n<p>All of this is to say, I\u2019m stoked for Summer Game Fest this year. It all kicks off with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-summer-game-fests-kickoff-stream-193047735.html\">a live show</a> on Friday, June 6, and we have a rundown of the full schedule <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-what-new-game-announcements-to-expect-how-to-watch-and-schedule-151743902.html\">right here</a>.

In a message shared on X, the studio\u2019s leaders said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t simply a difficult moment, it\u2019s a period of profound change in how games are created and financed. The landscape is shifting, and with it, so must we.\u201d Playtonic\u2019s latest game, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, is due to come out this year. Though Playtonic is a small, privately owned company (with a minority investment from Tencent), the timing of the layoffs fits the established playbook of many AAA studios, which operate with periods of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-04-anthem-crunch-bioware-ea-game-development.html\">crunch</a> and bulk layoffs baked into their business plans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ea-cans-black-panther\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-developing-it-213258110.html\"><strong>EA cans </strong><strong><em>Black Panther</em></strong></a></h3>\n<p>Electronic Arts revealed its plans to make a single-player, third-person Black Panther game back in 2023 as part of a broader Marvel push at the studio, but apparently, things have changed. EA canceled its Black Panther project and closed the studio that was building it, Cliffhanger Games. EA Motive, the team behind the stellar <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-remake-playstation-5-review-160019905.html\"><em>Dead Space</em> remake</a>, is still working on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ea-motive-iron-man-game-marvel-172055587.html\">an Iron Man game</a>, as far as we know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-roll7-returns-to-steam\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/roll7s-olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-are-back-on-steam-193536731.html\"><strong>Roll7 returns to Steam</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Any time I can gas up <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rollerdrome-preview-olliolli-skates-ps5-steam-160030108.html\"><em>Rollerdrome</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-gameplay-preview-140021521.html\"><em>OlliOlli World</em></a>, I\u2019m going to do it.

The lawsuit alleges Serge Hasco\u00ebt, Tommy Fran\u00e7ois and Guillaume Patrux regularly engaged in misconduct and fostered a toxic culture at Ubisoft, and it follows a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-sexual-misocnduct-allegations-092903220.html\">public reckoning at the studio in 2020</a>, plus <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/five-former-ubisoft-execs-arrested-following-sexual-harassment-investigation-135636454.html\">arrests in 2023</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-the-switch-2-is-coming\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-updates-ahead-of-the-june-5-launch-date-140931884.html\"><strong>The Switch 2 is coming</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Nintendo\u2019s Switch 2 officially comes out this week, on June 5.

At its most basic, this means establishing some kind of committee within the Alphabet board to oversee regulatory issues, of which Google has <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jury-sides-with-epic-games-in-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-032341810.html\">accrued many</a> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopoly-in-online-ad-tech-federal-judge-rules-151531919.html\">in the last few years</a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\"A new body made up of senior executives would meanwhile report directly to chief executive Sundar Pichai,\" <em>FT</em> writes, while another group \"consisting of product managers and internal compliance experts,\" would consult. The goal is to prevent Alphabet and its subsidiaries from making the kind of business decision that led to Google being deemed a monopoly on multiple counts. A judge will need to approve the settlement before the company can move forward, though.</p>\n<p>The case against Alphabet officials like Sundar Pichai and Sergey Brin was originally brought by a Michigan pension fund on behalf of shareholders <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/alphabet-hit-with-derivative-suits-on-antitrust-allegations\">back in 2021</a>.

In the grand scheme of things, changing how Alphabet deals with regulation will likely be one of the more minor ways the company's business is forced to change in the next few years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/alphabet-settles-with-shareholders-over-google-antitrust-lawsuit-195636653.html?src=rss",

At least until now.</p>\n<div id=\"9a09250ba2fc4ee187ce105e61a5f238\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKXJkIWRQMR/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div style=\"width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;\"></div> <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;\"></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKXJkIWRQMR/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Xbox Canada (@xboxcanada)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div> \n<p>The Xbox Series X Milk Pitcher comes in white or black and it can hold up to 1.3 liters (<em>fine</em>, if you insist, 2.75 pints) of bagged milk. That should give you enough fuel for your next <em>Halo Infinite </em>deathmatch battle or adventure in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-is-out-right-now-and-yes-theres-horse-armor-dlc-154801655.html\"><em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a>. Sadly, there\u2019s no word as yet if Xbox Canada is going to sell this thing or if it\u2019s just a fun marketing gimmick.</p>\n<p>I get it, bagged milk confused me too before my first visit to Canada as a teen. But milk in a bag is as Canadian as poutine, <em>Letterkenny</em>, hockey games on frozen ponds and The Beaches. As one of Engadget\u2019s Canadian contingent, it's my civic duty to test this out. My email\u2019s in my bio, Xbox.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-latest-xbox-kitchen-kitsch-is-a-series-x-milk-jug-for-canadians-184154694.html?src=rss",
